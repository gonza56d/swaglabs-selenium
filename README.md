# Test automation challenge: Swag Labs

---

## Description:
Python test automation project for [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

## Rules:
- Use Python 3.7 or newer version.
- Use Selenium to automate SwagLabs web app.
- Use virtualenv, although it must be git ignored.
- Add dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
- The project must work with both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
- The project must run in Windows, macOS and Linux.
- The POM and [BDD](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html) patterns must be followed.
- One branch per test implementation.
- Develop branch must be used.
- Use a separate Python file for project settings purposes.
- Use pyunitreport's HTMLTestRunner for HTML test reports. ([Quick example](https://github.com/gonza56d/pyrty_automation/blob/master/runner.py))

## Encouraged:
- Follow DRY as much as possible.
- Selenium actions wrapper methods with logs are fully encouraged.
- [Python typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) in parameters and return types are nice whenever possible.
- Documentation is always good way to be kind with your teammates and your future self (one-line comments and python docs).
- Running tests from the terminal instead of modifying code is always better. Try your own Python file that accepts arguments to run different tests/suites.
